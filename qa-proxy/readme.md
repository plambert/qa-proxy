This module proxies and rewrites HTTP requests of all types.
For this you can, if you want, use regular expressions.

Please note, that this is the first version of this module. It could have some security isses.
It could be really unstable too. Please report all bugs you find.


Example 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    var nhrp = require("nhrp");
    var fs = require("fs");
    
    
    function rewrite(request){
    
        /*  change some request information like this:
        request.host = "newdomain.com";     //for proxying to a new host
        request.port = 456;                 //for proxying to a new port
        request.url = "/a/b/c";             //for changing the url
        request.protocol = "HTTP/1.0";      //USE THIS WHEN THE REQUEST IS NOT A WEBSOCKET!
                                            //Otherwise, the connection wonÂ´t close.
        request.secure = false;             //for proxying https/wss to http/ws or vice versa    
        request.Header["User-Agent"] = "xyz";   //to change some headers
    
        //this would result in
        GET /a/b/c HTTP/1.0
        User-Agent: xyz
        
        PLEASE NOTE THAT THINGS THAT YOU DO NOT CHANGE WILL BE KEPT
        */
        return function(response){
    
            /* change some response information like this:
            response.code = 200;                //change the response code
            response.message = "OK";            //change the response message
            response.protocol = "HTTP/1.1";     //change the response protocol
            response.headers["Host"] = "olddomain.com"; //change the response headers
                                                        //this will be useful to match the request origin
    
            //this would result in
            HTTP/1.1 200 OK
            Host: olddomain.com
            */
        }
    }
    nhrp.createServer(rewrite).listen(80);              //create a server (http/ws) that listens for connections on port 80
    nhrp.createSecureServer({                           //create a secure server (https/wss) that listens for connections on port 443
        cert:fs.readFileSync("/root/certificate.pem"),
        key:fs.readFileSync("/root/key.pem")
    },rewrite).listen(443);                             //both server will now be rewritten by your rewrite function


Example 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    var nhrp = require("nhrp");
    var fs = require("fs");
    var rewriter = nhrp.createRewriter("/path/to/your/configfile.js");      //This rewriter automatically proxy your requests using the
                                                                            //regular expressions in the config file below
    
    nhrp.createServer(rewriter).listen(80);              //create a server (http/ws) that listens for connections on port 80
    nhrp.createSecureServer({                           //create a secure server (https/wss) that listens for connections on port 443
        cert:fs.readFileSync("/root/certificate.pem"),
        key:fs.readFileSync("/root/key.pem")
    },rewriter).listen(443);                             //both server will now be rewritten by your rewriter


configfile.js:
--------------

    /*
    Every request has the following sheme:
    PROTOCOL://HOST:PORT/URL
    
    PROTOCOL: This can be wss, ws, http or https
    HOST:   This is the requested domain like "example.com"
    PORT:   This is the requestsd port like 80,443 (this can simply be every port for that you have created a proxy server)
    URL:    The requestsed path like /path/to/my/site.html
    
    */
    
    [
        //this will proxy a request from http://example.com:80/tests/index.html to http://example.com:8080/index.html
        "^(http://example.com:80)/tests(.*)$ http://example.com:8080$2",
        
        //this will proxy all incoming http or https connections to example.com to http://example.com:8081
        //while the url wil be kept
        "^(http|https)://(example.com):([0-9]*)(.*)$ http://$2:8081$4",
    
        //this will proxy all incompin ws or wss connections to example.com/mywebsockets to ws://example.com:7070
        "^(ws|wss)://(example.com):([0-9]*)/mywebsocket(.*)$ ws://$2:7070$4"
    
    ]
    
    
If you proxy in incoming connection to this server again, you can add the option "R" at the end of the rule, so you don't have to create a new connection. So it will be much faster, if you apply 2 or more rules at once for 1 request.
Example:

    [
        "^http://subsite.com:80(.*)$ http://site.com:80/subsite$1 R",
        "^http://site.com:80(.*)$ http://localhost:8080"
    ]
    
This example proxies all requests on site.com @ port 80 to the fileserver at port 8080.
Requests subsite.com are rewritten to http://site.com/subsite[URL] first, after that, it will be proxied in the normal way to the fileserver @ port 8080.
